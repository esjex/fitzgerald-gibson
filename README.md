## What I do

I specialise in turning complex information into accessible technical content that makes your product easy for users to understand and use. My areas of expertise include:

* User manual and API documentation
* Tutorials and walkthroughs
* Technical articles and marketing content
* UI text and user journeys
* Internal technical communication

I have over a decade of experiences, and have worked on projects of all sizes, from major development software to small start-up tools. I also have experience leading projects, establishing quality processes, mentoring technical writers, and speaking at conferences all over the world.

## Who I am

I care about making information accessible, helping developers communicate their hard work, and increasing the quality of projects that support people. 

Outside of work, I provide docs and communications support to hobbyist projects and events. I also make zines and hobby resources, volunteer as a healthcare advocate, and teach a local community samba band.

My name is pronounced “**shiv-awn**”. Don’t worry about getting it wrong!
