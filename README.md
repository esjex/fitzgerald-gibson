## About me

Hello! I'm Siobhan (_shiv-awn_). I'm a [technical writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writer) specialising in high-quality software documentation.

## Technical content strategy and design

I turn complex information into accessible technical content, so that your product is easy to understand and use. My areas of expertise include:

* User manual and API documentation
* Tutorials and walkthroughs
* Technical articles and marketing content
* UI text and user journeys
* Internal technical communication

I have over a decade of experience working on projects of all sizes, from major development software to small start-up tools. I also have experience leading projects, establishing quality processes, mentoring technical writers, and speaking at international conferences.
