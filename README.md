## Technical Writer, Editor, & Content Strategist

Hello! I'm Siobhan. I'm a [technical writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writer) specialising in software documentation.

I turn complex information into accessible technical content, so that your product is easy to understand and use. My areas of expertise include:

* User manual and API documentation
* Tutorials and walkthroughs
* Technical articles and marketing content
* UI text and user journeys
* Internal technical communication

I have over a decade of experience working on projects of all sizes, from major development software to small start-up tools. I also have experience leading projects, establishing quality processes, mentoring technical writers, and speaking at conferences all over the world.

My name is pronounced “**shiv-awn**”. Don’t worry about getting it wrong!
