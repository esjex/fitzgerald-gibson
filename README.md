## Technical content for humans, by humans

I specialise in turning complex information into accessible technical content that makes your product easy for users to understand and use. My areas of expertise include:

* User manual and API documentation
* Tutorials and walkthroughs
* Technical articles and marketing content
* UI text and user journeys
* Internal technical communication

I’ve worked on projects of all sizes, from major development software to small start-up tools. In addition to writing technical documentation, I have experience leading projects, establishing quality processes, mentoring technical writers, and speaking at conferences all over the world.

## About me

I care about increasing the quality of projects that support people, by making information accessible and helping developers communicate their hard work. 

Outside of work, I provide docs and communications support to hobbyist projects and events. I also make zines and resources for my various communities, volunteer as a healthcare advocate, and teach a local community samba band.

My name is pronounced “shiv-awn”. Don’t worry about getting it wrong!
