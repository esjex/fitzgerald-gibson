## About me

Hello! I'm Siobh√°n (_shiv-awn_). I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writer" target="_blank">technical writer</a> specialising in high&#8209;quality software documentation.

### Technical writing, editing, and content strategy

I turn complex information into accessible technical content, so that your product is easy to understand and use. My areas of expertise include:

* User manual and API documentation
* Tutorials and walkthroughs
* Technical articles and marketing content
* UI text and user journeys
* Internal technical docs and communication

I have over a decade of experience working on projects of all sizes, from major development software to small start&#8209;up tools. I also have experience leading projects, establishing quality processes, mentoring technical writers, and speaking at international conferences.

### Information for good

Beyond my client work, I contribute docs and communications support to hobby projects and community events. I also write zines and resources, provide healthcare advocacy, volunteer at games and maker/hacker festivals, and teach music in a local samba band.
